## Example of an AngularJS App using RequireJS, ZURB Foundation & jQuery
===================

This is only an example. No test cases included.  
It only shows, how you can get AngularJS working together with RequireJS, ZURB Foundation and jQuery.  
  
### How it works  
  
To understand how all works together, you need to have basic unterstanding of AngularJS and RequireJS. 
If you don't have, this may help you:  
  
[AngularJS](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide "AngularJS Developer Guide")  
[RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html "RequireJS API Documentation")  
  
  
  
#### Folder Structure  
  
First of all we need to explain the folder structure.  
  
*Michi, you really should explain more ;)*
  
  
  
### TODO  
  
- [ ] add test cases for AngularJS  
- [ ] use sass classes from foundation
- [ ] use grunt to compile sass, build and minify main.css
- [ ] use grunt to concatenate and minify js files
